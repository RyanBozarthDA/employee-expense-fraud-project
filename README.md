# Employee Expense Fraud Project

This project analyzes employee expense claims for **June 2024** to identify potential policy violations and high-risk spending patterns.  
It combines **Power BI visualizations**, **SQL queries**, and **Excel cleansing and preparation** to give an investigative team clear, actionable insights.


## Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** – Initial data flagging, transformation, and rule-based logic
- **SQLite (SQL)** – Fraud logic, joins, aggregations, and anomaly detection queries
- **Power BI** – Dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, department/vendor breakdowns, slicers, and violation summaries

---

## Project Objectives

- Detect high-cost expense violations (over $500)
- Identify role-vendor mismatch (e.g., Sales spending at IT vendors)
- Flag duplicate or suspicious entries
- Present results in a clean, executive-ready Power BI report

---

## Key Insights

- Top employees by number of flagged violations
- Total spend by vendor and department
- High-risk vendors and departments with recurring issues
- KPI tracking for fraud categories and suspicious activity

---

## Key Metrics
- **81** total expense claims  
- **41** high-expense violations (> $500 threshold)  
- **8** role–vendor violations (mismatch between employee role and vendor category)  
- **$37.5K** total spend  
- **$462.57** average per claim  

---

## Insights
- **Top violators**: Certain employees (e.g., *John Smith*, *Carlos Reyes*) have repeated high-cost claims and appear in multiple violation types.
- **Departments at risk**: HR & IT record the most violations — suggesting targeted training or closer monitoring.
- **Spending trends**: Peaks in violations occur mid-month and around **June 9–10** & **June 16–18**.
- **Vendor categories**: Lodging & travel dominate spending — often high-risk for inflated claims.
- **Suspicious claim details**: Drill-down table enables quick investigation by showing employee, vendor, date, and flagged reason.

---

## Business Value
- Enables **faster fraud detection** and **policy enforcement**.  
- Directs audit resources toward the **highest-risk employees, departments, and vendors**.  
- Offers executives a **10-second KPI overview** and analysts a **data-driven investigation tool**.
